# Spatial Analysis of Satellite data

## Goal

To explore MODIS satellite Aqua/Terra data and calculate Vegetation Indexes over earth cover for Italy, Analysing data from SENTINEL-2 to perform Optical Remote Sensing including the monitoring of vegetation, soil and water cover, as well as observation of inland waterways & coastal areas, Surface Detection from Sentinel-1 data.

## Intro

Analysis of Satellite data from Modis, Sentinel-1 & 2 is done using SNAP tool and a particulat Region of Interest(ROI) was studied during Summer and Winter seasons. Resampling has been done and Machine Learning techniques such as Supervised and Unsupervised Learning are applied to classification Land, water, Urban and forest covers. A slight overview of original work are shown below.
